To build avsp, you will need:

Python (versions 2.5-2.7 supported)
wxPython (2.6-2.8 supported, 2.9 MAY work)
py2exe

The files msvcr90.dll and msvcp90.dll are expected to be located in your root python folder.
If you have these files located somewhere else, you can modify the file 'AvsP_setup.py' to point to the correct locations.

In order to UPX compress the files, you should put upx.exe in the same directory with the source code, but this is not required.
You can also specify a different location for upx.exe in the AvsP_build.py file.

To build, run AvsP_build.py
