What is AviSynth?
-----------------

AviSynth is a powerful tool for video post-production.  It provides ways 
of editing and processing videos.  AviSynth works as a frameserver, 
providing instant editing without the need for temporary files.

AviSynth itself does not provide a graphical user interface (GUI), but 
instead relies on a script system that allows advanced non-linear 
editing.  While this may at first seem tedious and unintuitive, it is 
remarkably powerful and is a very good way to manage projects in a 
precise, consistent, and reproducible manner.  Because text-based scripts 
are human readable, projects are inherently self-documenting.  The 
scripting language is simple yet powerful, and complex filters can be 
created from basic operations to develop a sophisticated palette of 
useful and unique effects.


What is AvsP?
-------------

AvsP is at its core a tabbed text editor with features specific for 
creating AviSynth scripts.  It has text editing features such as 
AviSynth-specific syntax highlighting and autocompletion to simplify the 
task of writing scripts.  However, its primary advantage over other 
editors is its integrated video preview, which remains attached to the 
main window at all times.  Comparing the visual results of several 
different scripts is as easy as writing the scripts into several 
different tabs and activating the video preview, switching between tabs 
gives instantaneous feedback on visual differences (anyone remember 
lining up multiple instances of VirtualDub and alt-tabbing?). 
Furthermore, the program offers a unique way for the user to define 
sliders for any number in the script, giving AviSynth a unique graphical 
interface never known before.  The following are an outline of the 
program's main features:

- Tabbed text editor
- Avisynth-specific syntax highlighting and autocompletion
- Integrated video preview for easy script comparison
- Unique user-defined sliders for rapid filter setting comparison
- Built-in crop editor in video preview
- Bookmark any number of frames for quick access
- Complete macro language using the Python programming language
- Graphical front-end for command-line compression tool avs2avi


What is AvsPmod?
----------------

The AvsP project was abandoned by its original author by late 2007. 
AvsPmod is a modified version of AvsP which provides some bug fixes 
and enhancements.
