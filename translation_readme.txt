In order to translate AvsP, you will need a file named "translation.py".  If you are updating a translation from an older version, simply place the old "translation.py" in the AvsP directory and run AvsP.  It will automatically update the translation file with all the new messages in the current version requiring translation.  If you are translating for the first time, simply place an empty text file named "translation.py" in the AvsP directory and run AvsP.  Open the translation file in your text editor of choice, and read the instructions within to begin translating the program.
